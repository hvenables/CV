#Harry Venables

Motivated and ambitious junior developer with a strong desire to learn.

I worked in digital marketing it was their that i got my first taste of programming and i was hooked. I gave up my job to join makers academy in september 2015 to learn the skills required to make a great developer. I am now looking to start a career in a company that will help me to continue my learning while contributing to cutting-edge, live production projects.

###Skills
---------------------------------

####Fast Learner  
At Makers Academy the ability to be a quick learn is almost a prerequisite of the course as things move so quickly. 

This ability to learn fast helped me during my final project where we chose to build a phone app using the ionic framework, despite having no previous experience with ionic.

####Problem Solving 
At AML i worked on large campaigns that went out in several countries in several languages and the management of the production of these projects fell to me.

I realised that the main problem was a lack of visibility of future work. When having large variations in workload we needed to ensure that we had capacity to meet the demand.

I solved this problem by implementing new systems. Along with the head of the Development department we introduce to Basecamp a project management software. I then built on this building large excel spreadsheets that automatically updated according to the date and the completion of the tasks.

####Teamwork
The ability to work in a team i have found is paramount to any working environment. I have developed these skills in several ways. We ran our final project with the agile methodologies, we used kanban system (waffle.io) to manage the workflow and had morning and afternoon stand ups to keep the team close. I am also a part of an FA affiliated football team UFC Farnham. Teamwork and unselfishness create the backbone of a great team, without them a team cannot realistically compete and at the time of completing this we are sitting third.

We built our final project in Ionic which is a framework which allows you to turn an angularjs app into a Android and iOS app. 

Ruby with PostgreSQL
Built a twitter clone using Sinatra with PostgreSQL, I was pleased with the refactoring of the controllers and also the MVC setup of the app. The project was deployed to heroku and can be found https://chittermessaging.herokuapp.com/

Built a instagram clone using Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL, I was pleased with how powerful rails was this allowed me to focus on the functionality and also the look and feel of the site which i was very pleased with. The project was deployed to heroku and can be found

MEAN stack
I worked on building a reddit clone (flapper news) using the MEAN stack. I am pleased with this project due to the separation of concern and single responsibility. I also used Karma and Protractor to test the app. The app is available at
